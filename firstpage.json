It was something I thought that people should be mature enough to handle, and if they weren\u2019t, then they weren\u2019t worth my time. In hindsight, this approach was probably really really stupid.", "\nWithin a few weeks of coming out, I got asked so, so many times about my body, my sexual attraction, everything. F*cking classmates asked me in the middle of maths lessons whether I really liked \u2018sticking my fingers up other girls\u2019; whether I was sure about my orientation, if I just hadn\u2019t had a good dicking yet and that was why I was so \u2018perverted\u2019. A person I\u2019d known for 3 years asked me if I was a boy now \u2013 because, in his mind, lesbians were transgender boys. A concept of girls liking girls seemed impossible to him, and he had the gall to ask me if my breasts were real (\u2018do lesbians have tits?\u2019). These were fourteen-year-old boys asking me these questions. I was absolutely disgusted \u2013 and hurt. That hurts, it hurts so much, when people see you \u2013 a classmate that they should respect and just leave alone \u2013 as some false-nails porn fantasy, as some \u2018bent queer\u2019 who just hasn\u2019t had the right cock in her yet. Couldn\u2019t they just leave me alone? Every other day people would ask me about my sexuality like they had a right to be invested in who I was and wasn\u2019t kissing.", "\nIn other instances, people told me that feminism was all about female domination and that feminists were just trying to take over the world and subdue men. The notion that feminism was still necessary didn\u2019t strike them despite the harassment and rape rates, the workplace discrimination statistics, all the other glaringly obvious things. Another time I got told that the only reason women were in lower job positions than men and there were fewer female executives/women in positions of power, was because women were naturally better at tending to children, and that it couldn\u2019t be asked of the father to look after them as it would be too much of a burden on his manly, manly soul. Societal and ingrained prejudices and normalized discrimination did not seem a real and actual thing to him.", "\nEvery time I confront someone on the way they treat women or LGBT+ people, they tell me I\u2019m making a fuss over nothing, that women and men are equal now, that \u2018societal prejudice\u2019 is just made up. And every time I think about this, I feel angrier and angrier. Because I feel as if there\u2019s nothing I can do. Some people will change their minds, but many never will and will die full of hate, racism, sexism, and homophobia.  I cannot change the way they think. I cannot pick a fight with every other builder on a street corner who tells me \u2013 a fourteen-year-old \u2013 that I have nice tits, I cannot argue with every classmate who tells me \u2018rape is just rough sex\u2019 and that \u2018it feels good after a while\u2019. I, a schoolgirl, am utterly powerless against the people who would objectify me. I have this raging, hot anger inside me, I want people to apologise, to see that gender equality is more than the right to vote and equal pay (which, by the way? Still not a thing). I want rapists to go to jail, I want sexism to be explained clearly and explicitly to every primary school child so that they know that sexism is still real, I want boys (and girls!!) to understand from a young age that doing anything without your partner\u2019s consent is wrong. I want this bullsh*t attitude of \u2018female dominance\u2019 to be discarded and for people to realize that they are scared of being emasculated. I want men to know that they can be raped too and that they shouldn\u2019t buckle down and shut up about it. I want prostitutes and sex workers to be treated equally \u2013 working in the sex industry does NOT equal lesser rights as a human being. I want slut-shaming to not be a thing, I want lesbians to stop being seen as either a fetish or a warped thing of nature, I want gay men to stop being seen as either creepy ass-rapist pedophiles or feminine sluts. I want transgender people to stop being seen as perverts who are trying to spy on you in the bathroom, I want women of color to stop being fetishized.", "\nIf I read this out to the boys at my school, there would be a divided reaction: many boys would leave laughing and joking about my hair, or how I shake when I\u2019m nervous or snicker as they leave abusive notes in my locker, but secretly feeling ashamed and angry about themselves. A positively minuscule number would openly agree, and I can almost guarantee that they would have female friends or be part of the LGBT+ community, and would know either first-hand what it\u2019s like to experience gender discrimination or have heard it from people they care about.

Now that I understand this was an explainable reaction for someone who had been sexually abused as a young child in a public hospital in mainland Europe (\u201cif you make a noise or tell anyone, they won\u2019t believe you\u201d), my reaction makes more sense but I still feel ashamed about it all.", "\nAlthough I\u2019ve mentioned to my long-term partner that I was raped, this is just one event from my very abused past and I\u2019ve never described the details to anyone before or been able to articulate them this clearly.
